## About Us

We are a group of individuals that believe that it should be possible to keep track of patient data regardless of where you are or if you have access to the internet. That's why we are working to create a solution for providers to allow them to use a slimmed down electronic health record (EHR) system that is self-contained and is able to run on a local network that does not need access to the internet!
